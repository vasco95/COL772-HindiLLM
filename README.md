# COL772-HindiLLM: Assignment on Building a Hindi Language Model

Welcome, students, to the COL772 HindiLLM assignment repository! This assignment is designed to guide you through the process of building and training components of a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for the Hindi language. You will be working on different stages, from data preparation and tokenization to model training.

## Running the Assignment Parts

Each part of the assignment can be run using a dedicated shell script. These scripts are designed to help you execute your code and test your implementations.

### Part A: Data Preparation and Initial Model

In this part, you will focus on implementing a basic model and data collating logic.

To run Part A:
```bash
bash run_parta.sh
```
You will need to implement the necessary logic in `parta/model.py` and ensure `parta/check.py` passes.

### Part B: BPE Tokenizer Implementation

Part B involves implementing a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer from scratch or using a library.

To run Part B:
```bash
bash run_partb.sh
```
Your BPE tokenizer implementation will go into `partb/bpe_tokenizer.py`. The `partb/train_tokenizer.py` script will use your implementation to train a tokenizer on `data/tokenizer_corpus.txt`.

### Part C: Training the Language Model

In Part C, you will integrate your tokenizer and implement the training loop for a language model.

To run Part C:
```bash
bash /run_partc.sh --train-tokenizer|--train-model
```
The core training logic will reside in `partc/train_model.py`.

## Important Notes

*   **Read the problem statement carefully:** Before starting any part, make sure you thoroughly understand the requirements and expectations.
*   **Incremental Development:** Work on one part at a time. Test your code frequently.
*   **Use the provided data:** The `data/` directory contains the necessary text files for training your tokenizer and language model.
*   **Check scripts:** The `run_part*.sh` scripts and `check.py` files are crucial for verifying your implementation. Make sure your code runs correctly through these scripts.
*   **Code Style:** Maintain clean, readable, and well-commented code.
